# Static Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation

In this project I implemented a static binary search tree from data stored in a file.
I then use that binary search tree, that I have implemented to help answer predecessor queries,
which are stored in another file containing a list of queries.

A predecessor of a given number is the largest number in the set that is at most the given number.

For example in the set S = { 34, 23, 11, 48, 54, 76 }, 
with predecessor query q = 42, its predecessor would be 34, 
as it is the largest number that is not greater than or equal to 42.
